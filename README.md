## Dashboard
The Dashboard displays the users top artists and tracks. Each entry allows the user to hover over itself to display additional information. The user can sort by different time ranges such as last month, last 6 months, and all time. When a user hovers over a track a preview begins to play for that song and when clicked on It brings up a modal displaying 40 recommended songs based on the clicked track.
